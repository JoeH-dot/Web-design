        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
        <p2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that can be used to customise the appearance of elements on a web page that uses a markup language. As an example CSS can be used to manipulate html element properties and to make animations, transitions, navbars and drop down menus.</p2>

                <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
                <p>Inline CSS is one of the ways you can incorporate CSS into your html files. Inline CSS allows you to edit the properties of a single element by typing the CSS code in the html tag of the element you want to edit which allows you to quickly make changes to the style of your website.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The image below is an example of inline CSS implemented in html.</p>

                <h3>Embedded CSS</h3>
                <p>Embedded CSS is another way you can incorporate CSS into your html files. Embedded CSS makes use of the style element that is put into the HEAD of the document. With embedded CSS you can edit the properties of all elemnts in the html document.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The image below is an example of embedded CSS that has been implemented into html.</p>

                <h3>External CSS</h3>
                <p>External CSS allows you to incorporate CSS into your html files with the use of an external CSS file which is linked to the html file you want to customise. This is useful as it allows you to keep your CSS code and html code is seperate files.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Below is an example of how an external CSS file can be linked to a html file.</p>

        <h2>Advantages and disadvantages of CSS Implementation</h2>
        <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>Advantages of inline CSS is that it allows for CSS to be quickly implemented during the early stages of website development. However the disadvantages of inline CSS is that the code is not reusable and you are only able to edit the properties of one element at a time. You would use inline CSS if you want to quickly test or implement CSS into a few specific elements to see what they would look like. This is because inline CSS can quickly be written within your html files to change the properties of specific elements but can quickly become inefficient if you are implementing CSS into your whole website because you would have to change the style of each element individually.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Embedded CSS</h3>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>Advantages of embedded CSS is that the code is reusable and it can be used to change the properties of multiple elements at once. However a disadvantage is that all of the code can take up a large amount of space in the html file causing slow loading times. You would use embedded CSS if you are producing a final prototype web page or if you plan on having a specific style for just that html file. This is because whilst you are developing the final prototype you have all of the code in one location and once it has been completed you can easily copy the code into an external css file. Also if you are planning on having a unique style for html files using embedded means you do not have to create multiple external css files which you will have to keep track of.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>External CSS</h3>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>Advantages of External CSS is that the code is reusable and the CSS file can be used to change the properties of elements on multiple html files. However a negative with external CSS is that if the client does not receive the css file then the website will not load properly. You will use external css for completed html files which will all have the same style. This is because external css files can be referenced by multiple html files allowing for them to all have the same style.</p>
        </div>

        <p></p>

        <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p2>CSS selectors are used to select specific elements of your html file which you would like to add CSS to. This allows you to create different styles for different elements in your website. There are many different types of CSS selectors, an example of some CSS selectors are class,element and id selectors.</p2>
            <p></p>
            <p2>Class selectors will select all elements which have the corresponding class. An example of this would be ".header" which will select all elements in the class named "header".</p2>
            <p></p>
            <p2>Element selectors are used to select all of the parts of a website which have a specific element. As an example if you use the element selector "h" this will select all header elements in the html file</p2>
            <p></p>
            <p2>Id selectors are used to select elements with a specific id attribute. An example of this would be "#test" which will select all elements with the id attribute "test".</p2>
        </div>

            <p class="ani">This is a linear animation which makes use of five keyframes which control the colour as well as the position of the square. In the image below you can see the CSS code I used to create this animation.</p>

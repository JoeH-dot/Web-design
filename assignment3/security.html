        <h2>Types of viruses</h2>
        <h3>Trojans</h3>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Trojan viruses are viruses which deceives the user by disguising itself as a genuine program or file. On the surface a trojan virus seems like a genuine file but once
                it has been downloaded, installed or opened it will then begin to perform malicious activities. To protect against a trojan virus the user should have an antivirus installed which
                will detect and delete any potential trojan viruses. Antiviruses work by using multiple methods to detect viruses. One of these ways is during a scan it will compare all the files
                to virus definitions. And if a file contains the same or similar data to the virus definitions the antivirus will then flag that file as infected. Another way an anti-virus detects 
                viruses is by using what is called “heuristics”. This I when the anti-virus looks for a large amount of suspicious activity coming from a specific file or application. This suspicious 
                activity could be trying to access system settings or self-duplication.

        <h3>Worms</h3>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Computer worms are a form of malware which self replicates and typically spread through networks by making use of network vulnerabilities. Worms are also commonly spread
                through malicious emails. Worms can be prevented by the use of an antivirus and by setting up a firewall. A firewall will prevent any suspicious packets from reaching your system.

        <h2>Hacking</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Hacking is gaining unauthorised access to a computer system via the use of vulnerabilities or exploits typically with malicious intentions. Hacking can be prevented by using several methods.
                Putting a password or passcode on your device will help prevent someone with physical access to the device from potentially hacking your device. This is because it makes it more difficult to gain full
                control of the device since the person will have to get past the login screen. Encryption can also be used to protect against hacking.

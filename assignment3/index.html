        <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Javascript is a programming language that is used in websites to make them more interactive with the use of scripts. A few examples
                of items on websites which make use of javascript are video players, login screens and browser games.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What is the nature of javascript?</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Javascript is a multi-paradigm language meaning that it makes use of multiple programming paradigms.
                The paradigms which javascipt uses are objected oriented programming (OOP), Event Driven Programming (EDP) and Functional Programming. This 
                makes javascript a very versatile language as it supports several programming styles.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Objects and Methods</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Javascript objects are variables which can store multiple different values known as properties. These properties determines an object's characteristics.
                Objects in javascript can be compared to objects in real life. For example a mug is an object which has properties that makes up it's characterisitics such as the material, colour and weight.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
                Methods in javascript are functions which are stored as object properties and can execute instructions which manipulates the object.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Event Handling</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Events are when the user interacts with elements on the website such as clicking a button. Javascript can be made to execute code when these events occur. 
                An example of this would be using the onclick html attribute which can be used to run code when the event with that attribute is clicked.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Security Issues</h2>
        <div class="cssinfo">
            <p>
                Whilst Javascript is a very popular and useful language for producing interactive websites there are several vulnerabilities which users could try to exploit causing
                security issues. And because the Javascript code is not compiled it makes it easy for users with malicious intent to look through the code to find potential vulnerabilities.
                One of the most common vulnerabilities websites using Javascript experience is cross-site scripting (XSS) which allows a hacker to inject malicious code into the website
                which will be executed when new users view the website.
